# # End Notes ðŸ“‘

In this project we were tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible with very limited knowledge of javascript & css.
This entire journey of making the project was awesome. We learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Although we could have done more, time did not allow us to go further. But we must improve it.
